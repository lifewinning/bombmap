Downtown Gallery Guide Map for BOMB. 

Uses [mapbox.js API v. 0.6.7](http://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v0.6.7) because 1.0 doesn't have easing and damn, easing looks good.

Also uses [Google Docs to Mapbox extension](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox.js/blob/master/extensions/mapbox.converters.googledocs.js). Original spreadsheet with points [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkuokbMVYNRxdEFPeFBZdkY0S05CWUZZcWFfaFpfeGc).
